PMCE: efficient inference of expressive models of cancer evolution with high prognostic power
===============================

In this repository we provide the code for the inference of Hidden Extended Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks (H-ESBCNs) in the directory named "HESBCN" and the scripts to replicate the PMCE analysis (directory named Utilities).

Please feel free to contact us if you have problems running our tool at daniele.ramazzotti@unimib.it or alex.graudenzi@ibfm.cnr.it.
